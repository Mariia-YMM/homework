        <h2>Ski Touring</h2>
        <p>
            Ski Touring is a winter sport which allows skiers to explore remote areas which are largely untouched.
            Instead of using chairlifts to get up the mountain, skiers will use their skis and poles to create new paths
            across unmarked areas.
